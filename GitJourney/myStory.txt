My name is Salman Omar and I am currentley a student in the Coding in Colour cohort. I am looking to make a career change into software development. 
I graduted from NAIT in Civil Engineering Technology, I have worked two years in the construction industry and during my time realized it was a career path not for me.
Fun Fact, I intitial wanted to purse Computer Science out of high-school but changed my mind mid-way through my grade 12 year.
